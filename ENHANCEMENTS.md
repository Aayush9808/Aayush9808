Optional enhancements for your profile README

- Streaks: enable the contribution streak card by uncommenting the line in README under the Stats section.
- LeetCode card: use a dynamic card service if desired (services change often); keep the plain profile link as a fallback for reliability.
- Badges: add shields.io badges for languages, frameworks, or certifications.
- Now section: add a short "Now" paragraph listing what you’re learning/building.
- Media: include a single clean screenshot or GIF of a flagship project linked to its repo.
