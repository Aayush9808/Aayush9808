Commits
- Follow Conventional Commits: feat:, fix:, docs:, chore:, refactor:, test:.

Pull Requests
- Keep PRs focused; include context, screenshots for UI, and steps to test.
- Ensure CI is green and linters pass before requesting review.

Code Style
- JS/TS: ESLint + Prettier; Python: Ruff + Black. Add configs to repos.

Issues
